      <p>
        I am the Group Production Director at award-winning women’s magazine
        <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/" target="_blank">Stylist.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        As well as helping to develop Stylist’s unique tone of voice and
        overseeing the creation of the magazine from initial flatplan to finished printed product, I have grown the food content across
        different platforms, editing the Gourmet On-The-Go page, securing
        interviews with the likes of Yotam Ottolenghi and Anna Jones, writing
        for our email newsletter
        <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/email" target="_blank"
          >Stylist Loves</a
        >
        and contributing to
        <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk" target="_blank">stylist.co.uk.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I write about all things food and drink, from
        <a href="pdfs/crumpets.pdf" target="_blank">gourmet crumpets</a>
        to

      <p>
        I have also hosted sessions at our annual Stylist Live event, and have
        worked on commercial collaborations with brands such as Clarins, Dyson
        and Virgin Trains.
